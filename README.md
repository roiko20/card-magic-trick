### Overview
I recalled a magic trick I really enjoyed doing as a kid.
<br/>
Then I thought, why not turn it into a React app?
<br/>
Check out the final result [here](https://roiko20.github.io/card-magic-trick/).

### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/roiko20/card-magic-trick`
<br/>
`yarn`
<br/>
`yarn start`
<br/>
Runs the app in the development mode.
<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### About
This was one of my first attempts to create a React app from scratch.
<br/>
The cards are fetched and managed using the [deckOfCards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) API.
<br/>
The APIs are invoked from the browser, using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
<br/>
I learned from this experience and it was fun to make it happen, already thinking about my next idea.
<br/><br/>
By following a specific set of actions on a deck of 21 cards, you can always know which card the user picked.
<br/>
For you to know which card it was, these actions must be performed in a very specific order.
<br/>
Creating the logic of the app to invoke the correct API at the right time, was the challenging part.
